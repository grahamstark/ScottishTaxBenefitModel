# A  Microsimulation Model of the Scottish Fiscal System

## This is in development and not ready for use

A Tax Benefit Model is a computer program that calculates the effects of possible changes to the fiscal system, for example tax increases or cash benefit reforms. 

We take a dataset with information on incomes, demographics, spending, etc. for a representative
sample of households. For each household in that dataset, the model calculates how much tax the household members are liable for under some
proposed tax and benefit regime, and how much benefits they are entitled to, and adds up the results. If the sample dataset
is representative of the population, and the modelling sufficiently accurate, the model can then tell you, for example,
the net costs of the proposals, the numbers who are made better or worse off, the effective tax rates faced by
individuals, the numbers taken in and out of poverty by some change, and much else.

This is a Tax Benefit Model for Scotland. To my knowledge, this is the first model specifically built for Scotland, and
the first fully Open Source one anywhere. It is designed to use data from the [Family Resources Survey](https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/familyresourcessurvey), possibly
augmented by other datasets later on.

For more information, try the following:

* I've started a [blog about the model](https://stb-blog.virtual-worlds.scot/). Pretty much stream of consciousness stuff as I write the model;
* A [short course on the ideas behind the model](https://stb.virtual-worlds.scot/intro.html), originally written for the UK's Open University;
* .. the course includes an [interactive section](https://stb.virtual-worlds.scot/tax-benefit-tour.html), using a very preliminary demo version of the model - **DONT USE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN PLAYING WITH**;
* .. also a section on [Budget Constraints](https://stb.virtual-worlds.scot/bc-intro.html);
* some Julia registered packages I've written containing model components:
  - A generator for [budget constraints](https://github.com/grahamstark/BudgetConstraints.jl);
  - Routines for [survey data weighting](https://github.com/grahamstark/SurveyDataWeighting.jl);
  - Various standard [measures of poverty & inequality](https://github.com/grahamstark/PovertyAndInequalityMeasures.jl).
