### Budget Constraints

Orthodox economics centres on an elaborate and controversial model of rational choice [Kay] alternatives [Khaneman, Satisficing] exist .. But it turns out we don't need much of this to get far in understanding choice - all we need is to enumerate the options open to them (and how these trade off..); the best choice is often then self-evident; for other cases we have some general principles to guide us.

* This is all interactive *

Start with a simple diagram: gross income (earnings) on x- net income (take-home) on y-

no taxes and benefits - 45°. Undistorted

[Digression on income/consumption/wealth]
[Digression on wages - map gross to hours on assumption of constant wage/reward for effort. Brief discussion of earnings/leisure choice Note we have this diagram backwards to standard economics treatment]

Now an income tax. 50% on income over £100.
3 ideas here:

* marginal tax rate - 0 then 50 key to understand how tax influences/distorts choice
* average tax rate share of tax in income. Key to non-marginal choices, such as migration (Scottish Higher rate);
* .. allowance has a 'cash value' of £50 (£100 * 50%). No universal name, but 'tax credit' is common. Useful tool for understanding distribution - 'cash value' of change.

1,3 and gross are enough to completely describe position, at least locally.

We'll come to a fourth below.

#### Cash Benefits

In might be impossible to live on the low incomes on the left of the diagram. So introduce a cash benefit. This could be:

* universal
* means-tested - withdrawn with incomes
* contingent - just to people who can't work through ..  or have extra needs because ..

example of each ...

4th measure: replacement rate

show how our measures still work - mtr 100, then 0, then 50 .. atr negative then positive

whole thing understandable as a system, but dangers there..

exercise: play around with graduated income tax, universal vs means tested benefits.. play with 100% vs < 100 benefit withdrawal - mention Universal Credit vs JSA/WTC/HB as real example.

some discussion:

* complexity,
* pros and cons of seeing Tax Benefit system as a single system;
* means testing vs universalism vs contingency
* equivalence of taxes and benefits
