### Indirect Taxation

### FIXME not implemented and maybe delete?

Our Family Resources Survey doesn't have expenditure data, so to model indirect taxes, we have to cheat slightly. Back in the discussion of households, we estimated *Engel Curves* showing the relationship between spending on some good and total spending using the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF). We can use a similar trick here.  

Note: how to include in Marginal Tax Rates

Exercise: consider imposing 20% VAT on the currrent 0 rates goods. What's the distributional effect of this? Look back at the Engel curve for food: what does that tell you about the distributional effects of VAT on food? Try to design a package that compensates the bottom 3 deciles for these changes.
