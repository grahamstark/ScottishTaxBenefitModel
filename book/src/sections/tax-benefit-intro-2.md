## (Finally) Introducing Our Model

Now we can go on to experiment with our model. We'll do this in two steps. Firstly, we'll use it to draw some *budget constraints* for a example person. This allows us to study in a simple way how taxes and benefits interact, and to introduce a few more concepts that can help us think about policy.

Then we'll move on to running our model on a complete FRS dataset.
