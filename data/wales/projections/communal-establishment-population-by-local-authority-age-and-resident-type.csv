(b) All Census tables are independently adjusted; this means that counts of the same population in two different tables may not necessarily be the same.
(c) Wards below the Standard Table thresholds (1,000 people and 400 households) were amalgamated with another ward within the same Local Authority for the release of Standard Tables.  A full list of these wards can be found at, http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/downloads/wards_below_st_threshold.xls
