"General description","Estimates of the number of dwellings in Wales by tenure and for each local authority, as at 31 March each year."
"Data collection and calculation","Estimates of the total dwelling stock are calculated based on data from the population censuses. The estimates are produced by using the dwelling count from the most recent 2011 census as a baseline. This count is then projected forward using information collected on annual changes to the dwelling stock through new build completions plus any gains or losses through conversions and demolitions.

The tenure split for Wales between owner-occupied and privately rented dwellings has been calculated using information from the Annual Population Survey (APS). Full details of the methodology are in the statistical release.

"Data reference periods","2000-01 onwards. Financial years.With the exception of Census years, the estimates presented relate to the end of each financial year i.e. estimates for 2019 relate to 31 March 2019."
"Users, uses and context","The dwelling stock estimates provide annual base line information on the overall amount of housing stock at a Wales and local authority level. It is used as evidence for policy making by both central and local government. The data are used by the Welsh Government, local authorities and other housing organisations to help monitor trends in the overall level of Welsh housing stock, as well as any changes in its tenure distribution over time. Outside of government the dwelling stock estimates are used by the finance and investment industries, for example to help develop a picture of demographic trends."
"Rounding applied","Due to the way in which the APS proportions have been applied, the Wales total may not equal the sum of the local authority numbers (and regions) for some tenures. The regional figures are calculated as the sum of the local authority numbers. "
"Revisions information","Revised data is marked with an (r). 

Estimates of tenure split for Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan, as at 31 March 2020,  have been revised on 21 September 2020 following the discovery of an error (now corrected).
