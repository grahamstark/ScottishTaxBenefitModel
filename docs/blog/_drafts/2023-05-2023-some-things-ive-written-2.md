### Affordabolity

Here are two papers (Stark 20xx, 20xx) written for the Office of the Scottish Charities Register (OSCR). OSCR were concerned out granting charitable status to (e.g.) private schools or golf clubs that few people could afford. The first of the two papers here discusses the literature on affordability as applied to, for example, affordable housing, fines levied by the courts and fuel poverty. The second describes a microsimulation model that shows the proportions of households who might be able to afford the proposed fees of some applicant for charitable status. Again, I believe this was the first model of its kind.

Austerity-era poverty interventions
Since beginning consultancy, I have received over -500,000 in funding from public and third sector bodies (Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly, United Nations, etc.), on top of regular grant acquisition while at the IFS (Nuffield, etc.). This has led to cutting edge research on the impact of austerity-era poverty interventions:
