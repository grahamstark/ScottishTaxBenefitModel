We're in the middle of the move from the Legacy Benefit to Universal Credit transition. Modelling this is tricky.

<!--more-->

This [keeps being delayed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51318730), of course, but the transition is around 60% complete. 

The best source of disaggregated information on this is the [House of Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-data-universal-credit-roll-out/#caseload). They do painstaking disaggregation of the transition using information from [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml) and the [HMRC Tax Credit Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/personal-tax-credits-statistics). But reasonably enough they break down by parliamentary constituency rather than local authority, which is all the infomation I have (and that only kinda-sorta). I can see what they're doing and am tempted to have a bash at an LA level decomposition; it would be a public service but I just don't have the time and it's a messy calculation. So the model uses Scotland-level averages.

It's evident that the DWP have gone for the easy ones first:

Proportion of benefit recipients transitioned to UC, September 2021

|-------------------|-------------------|
|    Overall      | 0.59 | 
|    With Housing Costs    | 0.61 |
|    Households With Children     | 0.55 |
|    Incapactity | 0.32 |
|    Job Seekers | 0.95 |

Since clearly a benefit unit (or household? it's not always clear) can be be seeking a job, and have children, a disability, and so, it's not absolutely clear how to apply this to a micro dataset, but the module [UCTransition.jl](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/UCTransition.jl) is my best effort.
