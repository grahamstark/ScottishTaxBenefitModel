# Council Tax Notes

From Interviewer notes, 2018

THIS MUST BE THE BAND GIVEN BY THE COUNCIL - DO NOT ACCEPT
RESPONDENT’S OWN ESTIMATE OF VALUE OF PROPERTY.

## Band I
COUNCIL TAX BAND I EXISTS IN WALES FOR PROPERTIES OVER £400,000.

## Accommodation not valued separately
If the accommodation is not separately valued for the council tax, enter ‘9’. In certain accommodation, such as that which is multiply occupied like bed sits, the landlord will be liable for the tax. The landlord may decide to recover some or all of the cost of the tax by increasing rent charges and will not be legally obliged to identify the council tax component. In these situations where the tenant is not personally liable for the tax use code 9 to indicate that the accommodation that the interview is concerned with is not valued separately for the Council Tax.

## Reduction scheme for disabled people

Step down 1 band for some households with a disabled person.  has at least one of the following:

* an extra kitchen or bathroom to meet the needs of a disabled person
* any other room (except a toilet) which is mainly used by a disabled person to meet their needs
* enough indoor space for a disabled person to use their wheelchair.
