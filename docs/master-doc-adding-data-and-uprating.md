# Model Maintenance master document - Adding Data, Uprating, Weighting, New Benefits, New Parameters

This tries to bring together everything in the convoluted steps needed to add a year's worth of data to the model (FRS/SHS), uprate the variables and create a new weighting target dataset. 

This is *convoluted*. I don't remember Taxben being this hard. Ideally I'd automate much of this - I had a brief go using some of the APIs for grabbing ONS data, but didn't get far. 

Always keep running the test suite while you're doing this.
