# Some possible very minor problems with your calculator

Dear developers,

I've been working on testing a new microsimulation tax benefit model for the UK. As part of that, I've been checking the benefits subsystem against your and Age Concern's online calculators. I'm hugely impressed with your work and comparing my results to yours has squashed many embarrasing bugs.

The model source code is here, if you're interested:

And the first output is a budget constraint simulator for my students:

There are just a few cases I've found where I don't think you're quite right:

## Scottish Child Payment

xx

##

# Test, Test, Test

policy in practice
bcs
lack of worked examples

# Scotland's new benefits



# Scotland's Kinkiest Households

20 odd years ago I wrote [an algorithm to generate Budget Constraints]() with [Alan Duncan]().
