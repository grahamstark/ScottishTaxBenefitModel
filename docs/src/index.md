# ScottishTaxBenefitModel

## A  Microsimulation Model of the Scottish Fiscal System

This is **in development**, has just been moved from an earlier version, and so will likely break in all sorts of unpleasant ways.

Please bear with me, or better still, help.

One quick note: my packages:

* [Budget Constraints](https://github.com/grahamstark/BudgetConstraints.jl);
* [Reweighting](https://github.com/grahamstark/SurveyDataWeighting.jl); and
* [Poverty & Inequality](https://github.com/grahamstark/PovertyAndInequalityMeasures.jl)
